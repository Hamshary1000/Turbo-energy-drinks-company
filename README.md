The Marketing team is responsible for increasing brand awareness, market share, and product development.
They conducted a survey in those 10 cities and received results from 10k respondents.

- **Consumer Preferences:** reviews, pereception, Preferred times ,situations  and frequencies.
- **•Product Development:** prefered improvements, ingredients expected and packaging preferences.

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings
Turbo's launch in Egypt is off to a decent start, with almost half (44%) of those surveyed knowing the brand already.  Most of the people who answered the survey were men (60%), so Turbo might need to find ways to connect better with women.  They seem to be doing well in the big cities like Cairo and Alexandria, where most people live, but they should think about how to reach people in other cities too.  Young adults are their main customers right now, which is normal for energy drinks, but there's a good number of slightly older folks (31-45 years old) who might also be interested.  Finally, it looks like online ads are working best for them, and since most people are buying in the 50–150-pound range, Turbo needs to keep prices reasonable

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
